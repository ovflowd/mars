# General Guidelines

## Opening an issue, or replying to an issue

In this repository, issues serve many functions. Here's some things you could open an issue for:

- To discuss a topic of interest with other students.
- To ask a question about the training.
- To ask for advice about how to take the next step with the skills you've learnt.
- To give feedback.
- To suggest a new feature.

## Contributing

Throughout the training, you might find bugs, typos, or just plain boring content. We welcome contributions and help.

However, we want to make sure that you don't waste your valuable time. Before making a large pull request, open an issue describing what you want to fix. This helps us work with you to make sure the PR will be accepted, and your time isn't wasted.

**Remember to search past issues and pull requests in case your question or bug has been commented on before.**
